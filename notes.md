# Notes

- Traditional Routing(calling the component inside the page.tsx using imports)
- Page Routing(inside the src there need to be a page directory inside that the about.jsx, signIn.jsx files can be used using Link)
- App Routing (Folder based routing) (Normally what i use a About folder inside that page.jsx, layout.jsx etc. for more dynamic approach)
